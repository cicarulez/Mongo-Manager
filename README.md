# MongoDB User Management and Data Export Script

This script is a Node.js application that facilitates MongoDB database operations such as user management and data export. It provides an interactive command-line interface (CLI) for creating, deleting, and updating user passwords, as well as exporting and listing exported data from a MongoDB collection.

---

## Features

### 1. **User Management**
- **Create User**: Add new users to the specified user collection.
- **Delete User**: Remove users from the database.
- **Change Password**: Update passwords for existing users.

### 2. **Export Options**
- **Export Data**: Export all documents from the specified data collection into a JSON file.
- **List Data**: View all previously exported files.

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher.
- **MongoDB**: Connection URI with a placeholder `<password>` for secure integration.
- **Environment Variables**:
    - `MONGO_URL`: MongoDB connection URI.
    - `DATA_COLLECTION_NAME`: Name of the data collection to export.
    - `USER_COLLECTION_NAME`: Name of the user collection for user management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cicarulez/mongo-manager/
   cd src
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following variables:
      ```env
      MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
      COLLECTION_NAME=data_collection_name
      USER_COLLECTION_NAME=user_collection_name
      ```
    - Replace only `<username>`, `data_collection_name` and `user_collection_name` with your MongoDB credentials and collection name.
    - Please do not replace `<password>`.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## Key Notes

- **Password Security**: User passwords are securely hashed using `bcrypt` before storing in the database.
- **Error Handling**: Validations ensure that required environment variables are set and MongoDB connection issues are logged.
- **Interactive CLI**: Designed for ease of use with clear prompts and structured menus.
